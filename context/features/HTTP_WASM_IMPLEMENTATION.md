# HTTP WASM Test Runner

⚠️ **DEPRECATION NOTICE** ⚠️

**This document describes an OUTDATED API.** The `/api/load` endpoint no longer accepts a `wasmType` parameter. WASM type is now **automatically detected**.

**For current API documentation, see:**
- `context/development/AI_AGENT_API_GUIDE.md` (up-to-date API docs)
- `context/features/HTTP_WASM_UI.md` (current behavior with auto-detection)
- `docs/API.md` (REST API reference)

**Last Updated**: This document is outdated as of February 2026 and should not be used.

---

## Overview (OUTDATED)

The fastedge-debugger server now supports both **Proxy-WASM** (CDN apps) and **HTTP WASM** (component model with wasi-http interface) test execution.

**NOTE**: The information below is OUTDATED. The API has changed to use automatic WASM type detection.

## Architecture

### Runner Pattern

```
IWasmRunner (interface)
├── ProxyWasmRunner (existing, proxy-wasm ABI)
└── HttpWasmRunner (NEW, FastEdge-run process-based)
```

**Factory**: `WasmRunnerFactory` creates appropriate runner based on explicit `wasmType` parameter.

### HTTP WASM Runner

- **Process-based**: Spawns `fastedge-run http` as a long-running process
- **Port management**: Allocates ports from 8100-8199 range
- **Request forwarding**: Forwards HTTP requests to local FastEdge-run server
- **Log capture**: Captures stdout/stderr from the process
- **Cleanup**: Kills process, releases port, removes temp files

## API Changes

### /api/load (Modified)

**Required parameters**:
- `wasmBase64`: Base64-encoded WASM binary
- `wasmType`: `"http-wasm"` or `"proxy-wasm"` (explicit, required)
- `dotenvEnabled`: Boolean (optional, default: true)

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5179/api/load \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "wasmBase64": "...",
    "wasmType": "http-wasm",
    "dotenvEnabled": true
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "wasmType": "http-wasm"
}
```

### /api/execute (NEW)

Unified endpoint that works with both WASM types:

**For HTTP WASM**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5179/api/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "http://example.com/path?query=value",
    "method": "GET",
    "headers": {"user-agent": "test"},
    "body": ""
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": {
    "status": 200,
    "statusText": "OK",
    "headers": {"content-type": "text/html"},
    "body": "...",
    "contentType": "text/html",
    "isBase64": false,
    "logs": [
      {"level": 2, "message": "Request processed"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**For Proxy-WASM**: Calls `callFullFlow()` with full request/response data.

### /api/call and /api/send (Unchanged)

Existing endpoints for Proxy-WASM hooks remain unchanged for backward compatibility.

## FastEdge-run CLI Discovery

The HTTP WASM runner discovers the FastEdge-run CLI in this order:

1. **FASTEDGE_RUN_PATH** environment variable
2. **Bundled binary** in `fastedge-cli/` at project root (platform-specific)
3. **PATH** (using `which`/`where`)

**Installation**:
```bash
cargo install fastedge-run
```

Or set the path:
```bash
export FASTEDGE_RUN_PATH=/path/to/fastedge-run
```

## Configuration

### Dotenv Support

HTTP WASM runner passes `--dotenv` flag to FastEdge-run when enabled:

```bash
fastedge-run http -p 8181 -w binary.wasm --wasi-http true --dotenv
```

FastEdge-run will load `.env`, `.env.local`, etc. automatically.

### Port Management

- **Range**: 8100-8199 (100 ports available)
- **Allocation**: First available port
- **Cleanup**: Port released when runner is cleaned up or reloaded

## Testing

### Vitest Integration Tests

Run the integration tests:

```bash
pnpm run test:integration        # Run all integration tests (CDN + HTTP in parallel)
pnpm run test:integration:cdn    # Run only CDN tests
pnpm run test:integration:http   # Run only HTTP WASM tests
```

**Test Organization**:
```
server/__tests__/integration/
├── cdn-apps/           # Proxy-WASM tests (19 tests, parallel, ~300ms)
│   ├── fixtures/       # Test WASM binaries
│   └── property-access/
├── http-apps/          # HTTP WASM tests (12 tests, sequential, ~31s)
│   ├── sdk-basic/      # Basic execution tests
│   │   └── basic-execution.test.ts
│   └── sdk-downstream-modify/  # Downstream fetch tests
│       └── downstream-modify-response.test.ts
└── utils/              # Shared test utilities
    ├── wasm-loader.ts
    └── http-wasm-helpers.ts
```

**Test Configurations**:
- `vitest.integration.cdn.config.ts` - CDN tests run in parallel (fast!)
- `vitest.integration.http.config.ts` - HTTP WASM tests run sequentially (avoid process contention)
- Both test suites run in parallel with each other via npm-run-all2

**HTTP WASM Tests** (sdk-basic/basic-execution.test.ts):
1. Load HTTP WASM binary and spawn FastEdge-run process
2. Execute GET request and return response
3. Return correct content-type header
4. Return text body without base64 encoding
5. Capture logs from FastEdge-run process
6. Handle path with query parameters
7. Pass custom headers to WASM app
8. Handle POST request with body
9. Report correct runner type ('http-wasm')
10. Throw error when executing without loading WASM
11. Throw error when calling proxy-wasm methods
12. Allow reload after cleanup

**Performance**:
- CDN tests: ~300ms (19 tests, 5 files, parallel)
- HTTP WASM tests: ~31s (12 tests, 1 file, sequential)
- Total wall-clock time: ~31s (35% faster than fully sequential)
- HTTP WASM tests: Load once in `beforeAll`, reuse runner across tests (~1s per test)
- Reload test: Tests cleanup/reload with separate instance (~17s, expected)

### Manual Testing

**Test HTTP WASM**:
```bash
# Load
WASM_BASE64=$(base64 -w 0 wasm/http-apps/sdk-examples/sdk-basic.wasm)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5179/api/load \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"wasmBase64\": \"$WASM_BASE64\", \"wasmType\": \"http-wasm\"}"

# Execute
curl -X POST http://localhost:5179/api/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "http://example.com/", "method": "GET"}'
```

**Test Proxy-WASM**:
```bash
# Load
WASM_BASE64=$(base64 -w 0 wasm/cdn-apps/properties/valid-url-write.wasm)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5179/api/load \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"wasmBase64\": \"$WASM_BASE64\", \"wasmType\": \"proxy-wasm\"}"

# Execute
curl -X POST http://localhost:5179/api/call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "hook": "onRequestHeaders",
    "request": {"headers": {"host": "example.com"}, "body": ""},
    "response": {"headers": {}, "body": ""}
  }'
```

## WebSocket Events

### New Event: http_wasm_request_completed

Emitted when an HTTP WASM request completes:

```typescript
{
  type: "http_wasm_request_completed",
  timestamp: 1234567890,
  source: "ui",
  data: {
    response: {
      status: 200,
      statusText: "OK",
      headers: {...},
      body: "...",
      contentType: "text/html",
      isBase64: false
    },
    logs: [
      {level: 2, message: "..."}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### CLI Not Found
```
Error: fastedge-run CLI not found. Please install it or set FASTEDGE_RUN_PATH
```

**Solution**: Install FastEdge-run or set FASTEDGE_RUN_PATH

### Port Exhaustion
```
Error: No available ports in range 8100-8199
```

**Solution**: Cleanup old runners, restart server, or increase port range

### Process Timeout
```
Error: FastEdge-run server did not start within 5000ms on port 8181
```

**Solution**: Check FastEdge-run logs, verify WASM binary is valid

## Known Issues

### 1. downstream-modify-response.test.ts - Consistent Startup Failures

**Status**: Test suite currently skipped (see line 26 of the test file)

**Symptom**: The downstream-modify-response test consistently fails to start FastEdge-run in test environment:
```
Error: FastEdge-run server did not start within 20000ms on port 8100
```

**Manual Testing**: The binary works perfectly when tested manually via curl or direct execution

**Possible Causes**:
- Network-related (test makes external API fetch to jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
- Resource limits in test environment
- Timing issues with external dependencies
- Environment-specific configuration

**Workaround**: Test suite is skipped with `describe.skip()` and documented with TODO comment

**Future Investigation**:
- Test with mock external API server
- Increase timeout beyond 20s for binaries with external dependencies
- Add retry logic for network-dependent tests
- Consider separate test category for tests requiring external network access

### 2. Process Cleanup Signal - SIGINT Required

**Issue**: FastEdge-run CLI only responds to SIGINT for graceful shutdown, not SIGTERM

**Discovery**: Found in FastEdge-vscode source code (FastEdgeDebugSession.ts:264)

**Impact**:
- Original implementation using SIGTERM caused ~17s cleanup delays
- Changed to SIGINT reduced cleanup time to ~6.5s

**Implementation**: `HttpWasmRunner.killProcess()` now uses SIGINT with 2s timeout before SIGKILL fallback

**Fixed in**: commit that changed `this.process.kill("SIGTERM")` to `this.process.kill("SIGINT")`

### 3. Redundant Cleanup Tests Removed

**Issue**: Separate "Cleanup and Resource Management" tests were causing resource contention when running in parallel with CDN tests

**Symptom**: Test "should cleanup resources after execution" would fail on port 8101 after 22s when running alongside CDN tests

**Root Cause**:
- Test created a separate runner instance for cleanup testing
- Competed for resources during parallel test suite execution
- Cleanup functionality already validated by:
  - `afterAll`/`afterEach` hooks that run successfully
  - "should allow reload after cleanup" test (still passes)
  - Sequential port allocation working without conflicts

**Resolution**: Removed redundant cleanup tests from sdk-basic/basic-execution.test.ts

**Rationale**: Per user requirement - "This will not need to re-test all the clean-up logic or different basic tests that we have already tested"

### 4. Port Management and TCP TIME_WAIT

**Issue**: Tests need delays between port reuse due to TCP TIME_WAIT state

**Solution**:
- Implemented sequential port allocation (8100, 8101, 8102...)
- Shared PortManager singleton prevents port conflicts
- 1-2s delays in test cleanup to allow OS to fully release ports

**Files**:
- `server/runner/PortManager.ts` - Sequential allocation with `lastAllocatedPort` tracking
- `server/__tests__/integration/utils/http-wasm-helpers.ts` - Shared singleton

### 5. Test Suite Organization - Sequential vs Parallel

**Decision**: Split test execution into two parallel streams with different concurrency models

**Rationale**:
- CDN tests are fast (~300ms) and benefit from parallel execution
- HTTP WASM tests are slow (~31s) and suffer from process contention when parallel
- Running both suites in parallel with each other gives 35% speed improvement

**Implementation**:
- `vitest.integration.cdn.config.ts` - Parallel within suite
- `vitest.integration.http.config.ts` - Sequential within suite (`fileParallelism: false`)
- `npm-run-all2` runs both configs in parallel
- Total wall-clock time: ~31s vs ~46s if fully sequential

## Future Enhancements

### UI Integration
- Show WASM type badge (Proxy-WASM vs HTTP WASM)
- Hide hooks panel for HTTP WASM
- Simple request/response interface for HTTP WASM
- Subscribe to `http_wasm_request_completed` events

### Features
- Auto-detect WASM type from binary
- Hot reload on WASM file changes
- Request history/replay
- Performance metrics
- Multiple concurrent runners

## Backward Compatibility

All existing Proxy-WASM functionality remains unchanged:
- `/api/call` - Hook execution
- `/api/send` - Full flow execution
- WebSocket events for hooks
- Property system
- Dotenv loading

New functionality is opt-in via explicit `wasmType` parameter.
