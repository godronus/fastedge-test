## Critical Technical Details

### Header Serialization Format

**This was the major breakthrough.** The G-Core AssemblyScript SDK expects a specific binary format:

```
[num_pairs: u32]              # Header pair count
[key1_len: u32][val1_len: u32]  # Size array for all pairs
[key2_len: u32][val2_len: u32]
...
[key1_bytes][0x00]            # Data with null terminators
[val1_bytes][0x00]
[key2_bytes][0x00]
[val2_bytes][0x00]
...
```

**Example** (2 headers: "host: example.com" and "x-custom-relay: Fifteen"):

```
02 00 00 00                   # 2 pairs
04 00 00 00 0b 00 00 00       # "host" = 4 bytes, "example.com" = 11 bytes
0e 00 00 00 07 00 00 00       # "x-custom-relay" = 14 bytes, "Fifteen" = 7 bytes
68 6f 73 74 00                # "host\0"
65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 2e 63 6f 6d 00  # "example.com\0"
78 2d 63 75 73 74 6f 6d 2d 72 65 6c 61 79 00  # "x-custom-relay\0"
46 69 66 74 65 65 6e 00       # "Fifteen\0"
```

This format is implemented in `server/runner/HeaderManager.ts`.

### Property Path Resolution

Properties use null-separated paths with smart runtime calculation:

- **Static properties**: Set by user in UI, stored in config
- **Runtime properties**: Extracted from URLs (host, path, query, etc.)
- **Priority**: User properties override runtime-calculated values
- **Path separators**: `\0` (null), `.` (dot), `/` (slash) all supported

Example: `request\0path` → extracts `/api/endpoint` from URL

See [PROPERTY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md](./features/PROPERTY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) for details.

### Host Header Auto-Injection

The test runner automatically injects the `Host` header from the target URL before hooks execute:

- Format: `hostname` or `hostname:port` (non-standard ports only)
- Standard ports (80, 443) omitted from header value
- Native `fetch()` may override, but WASM hooks see correct value
- Original host preserved as `X-Forwarded-Host` during HTTP fetch

## How to Use (Detailed)

### Running the Server

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build  # Builds both backend and frontend
pnpm start      # Starts server on port 5179
```

Or run in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev:backend    # Runs backend with watch mode
pnpm run dev:frontend   # Runs Vite dev server on port 5173 (with proxy to backend)
```

### Build Commands

- `pnpm run build` - Build both backend and frontend
- `pnpm run build:backend` - Build only backend (TypeScript → dist/)
- `pnpm run build:frontend` - Build only frontend (React → dist/frontend/)
- `pnpm run dev:backend` - Run backend in watch mode
- `pnpm run dev:frontend` - Run Vite dev server with hot reload

### Debug Mode

Set `PROXY_RUNNER_DEBUG=1` to see detailed logs:

- Host function calls
- Memory operations
- Header hex dumps
- Trap information

### Loading a Binary

1. Open http://localhost:5179
2. Click file input and select a .wasm file
3. File is read in browser and sent as base64 to `/api/load`
4. Wait for success message

### Running Hooks

1. Configure request headers, body, trailers (supports key:value format)
2. Configure response headers, body, trailers
3. Set properties (JSON format)
4. Select log level (default: Info)
5. Click "Run All Hooks" or individual hook buttons
6. View output with logs and return codes

Path separators supported: `\0` (null), `.` (dot), `/` (slash)

## Development History

### Evolution of the Project

1. **Initial**: Monolithic 942-line ProxyWasmRunner.ts
2. **Refactoring**: Split into 6 modular files for maintainability
3. **Header Format Discovery**: Critical breakthrough in G-Core SDK format
   - Tried: simple length-prefixed format ❌
   - Tried: null-terminated strings only ❌
   - Tried: count prefix without null terminators ❌
   - **Success**: Count + size array + null-terminated data ✅
4. **Frontend Migration**: Vanilla JS → React 19 + Vite + TypeScript
   - Component-based architecture for better maintainability
   - Type-safe API layer
   - Modern development workflow with hot reload
5. **UI Redesign** (January 2026):
   - Moved "Send" button to request bar (Postman-like)
   - Tabbed hook stages panel with Logs/Inputs views
   - Response viewer with Body/Preview/Headers
   - Smart tab visibility based on content type
6. **HTTP Integration**: Added actual fetching between hooks
   - Request hooks modify headers/body
   - Real HTTP request with modifications
   - Response hooks process real server response
   - Binary content handling with base64 encoding
7. **State Management Migration** (February 6, 2026):
   - Migrated from useState to Zustand
   - 5 modular slices: Request, WASM, Results, Config, UI
   - Auto-save functionality with localStorage persistence
   - 176 comprehensive tests for stores
   - Improved maintainability and testability
8. **Project Structure Reorganization**:
   - `src/` → `server/` for clarity
   - Separate `frontend/` directory
   - Base `tsconfig.json` extended by both backend and frontend
   - Build outputs: `dist/` (backend at root, frontend at dist/frontend/)

2. Request/response history
3. Enhanced diff view for header/body changes
4. Integration with CI/CD pipelines
5. WASI-HTTP component model integration

---

## Debugging Tips

### Common Issues

**Headers not parsing correctly**
- Check hex dump in debug logs
- Verify format matches G-Core SDK expectations
- Ensure null terminators are present

**Hook returns unexpected value**
- Check logs for "debug: host_call ..." to see what WASM requested
- Verify property values are set correctly
- Check that header format is correct

**WASM initialization fails**
- Usually non-critical if hooks still execute
- Check what host functions WASM imports vs what we provide
- Add missing functions to HostFunctions.ts if needed

**Memory errors**
- Ensure allocator is available (proxy_on_memory_allocate or malloc)
- Check memory growth in MemoryManager.hostAllocate()
- Verify pointers aren't out of bounds

**WebSocket connection issues**
- Check connection status indicator in UI
- Verify server is running on correct port (5179)
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Auto-reconnection should handle temporary disconnects

**Dotenv not loading**
- Verify .env files exist in project root
- Check dotenv toggle is enabled in UI
- Look for WASM reload confirmation
- Check server logs for file read errors

---

## Example Usage

### Example Request Configuration

```json
// Request Headers
{
  "host": "example.com",
  "x-custom-header": "value",
  "content-type": "application/json"
}

// Request Body
{
  "message": "test request"
}

// Properties
{
  "root_id": "httpheaders",
  "fastedge.trace_id": "test-123",
  "request.method": "POST"
}
```

### Example Test Scenario

1. Load `change-header-code.wasm`
2. Set method to POST, URL to `https://httpbin.org/post`
3. Add custom headers in request
4. Add JSON body
5. Configure properties
6. Click "Run All Hooks"
7. Observe:
   - Request hooks modify headers/body
   - HTTP request sent with modifications
   - Response hooks process server response
   - Logs show all hook executions
   - Inputs/Outputs tabs show diffs
