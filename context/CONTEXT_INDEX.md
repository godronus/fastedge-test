## 🔍 Search Tips

### Don't Read CHANGELOG.md Linearly

It's ~4,287 lines (Feb 2026+)! Use grep instead. For Jan 2026 and earlier, grep `legacy/CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`:

```bash
# Find when feature was implemented
grep -i "feature-name" context/CHANGELOG.md

# Find bug fixes
grep -i "fix.*bug-keyword" context/CHANGELOG.md

# Find recent changes to a file
grep -i "filename" context/CHANGELOG.md
```

### Search Across Feature Docs

```bash
# Find all docs mentioning a topic
grep -r "websocket" context/*.md

# Find implementation patterns
grep -r "pattern-name" context/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
```

### Use Section Headers in Large Docs

Large docs like `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` and architecture docs have clear section headers. Use grep to find the section you need:

```bash
# Find specific section
grep -n "## Section Name" context/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
```

## ⚡ Quick Action Patterns

**Pattern 1: Feature Implementation**

```
Read: IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md + relevant architecture doc section + feature doc
Grep: CHANGELOG.md for similar features
Time: 5-10 minutes of reading vs. 20-30 minutes reading everything
```

**Pattern 2: Bug Fix**

```
Read: Feature doc for broken feature + TESTING_GUIDE.md
Grep: CHANGELOG.md for feature history
Time: 3-5 minutes of reading
```

**Pattern 3: WASM Work**

```
Read: Relevant wasm/*.md file + FASTEDGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md sections
Grep: Codebase for examples
Time: 5-7 minutes of reading
```
